Telco Customer Churn Prediction
Project Type
Classification
Project Summary
The Telco Customer Churn Prediction project aims to address a critical challenge in the telecom industry: customer churn. By building predictive models and analyzing historical customer data, this project provides insights into the factors driving churn and enables proactive measures to retain customers and enhance profitability

Key Objectives
- Data Exploration and Preprocessing:- Explore and clean the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and engineer new features.

- Data Visualization:- Use visualizations like bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.

- Modeling and Evaluation:- Implement machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- Hypothesis Testing:- Validate insights with statistical methods like Z-tests and T-tests to test hypotheses about customer behavior.

- Feature Engineering:- Enhance model performance through effective feature engineering techniques, excluding PCA unless necessary.

- Handling Imbalanced Data:- Address the class imbalance challenge using techniques like SMOTE.



Problem Statement
The telecom industry faces high annual churn rates (15–25%), resulting in revenue loss. Acquiring new customers is significantly costlier than retaining existing ones. This project seeks to predict churn and identify its drivers to reduce churn rates and improve customer retention strategies.
Dataset Information
- Source: IBM Data and AI Accelerators
- Description: Data from a fictional telco company in California, covering 7043 customers in Q3. Key attributes include demographics, account information, subscription details, and churn indicators.

Technical Stack
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost.
- Statistical Tests: Z-tests, T-tests.


Business Impact
This project enables proactive, data-driven retention strategies, helping telecom companies:
- Reduce churn rates.
- Launch targeted retention campaigns.
- Increase customer lifetime value (CLTV).
- Improve long-term profitability.

- Exploring deep learning methods for more advanced modeling.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of machine learning techniques to address the critical business challenge of customer churn in the telecom industry. Using the XGBoost Classifier, enhanced with hyperparameter tuning, the project achieved exceptional predictive performance, providing valuable insights for proactive customer retention strategies.
Key Takeaways:
- Model Selection and Performance:
XGBoost was chosen for its high efficiency and robustness in classification tasks. The model delivered perfect scores across evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC, underscoring its ability to distinguish between retained and churned customers.
- Hyperparameter Tuning:
Systematic hyperparameter tuning through GridSearchCV ensured optimal parameter selection, enhancing the model’s accuracy and generalizability. Cross-validation further helped prevent overfitting, maintaining consistent performance across datasets.
- Feature Importance:
Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), Churn Value and Churn Score emerged as the most influential predictors of churn. These insights empower telecom businesses to prioritize critical factors in their retention strategies.
- Business Impact:
The predictive capabilities of the model enable companies to:- Launch targeted campaigns for high-risk customers.
- Optimize service plans and pricing strategies.
- Foster customer loyalty and increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV).
- Minimize revenue loss by addressing churn drivers effectively.

Practical Recommendations:
To reduce customer churn, the following strategies are suggested:
- Plan Optimization: Revise charges for services like the International Plan to stay competitive.
- Proactive Communication: Engage with customers regularly to address potential concerns before they lead to churn.
- Retention Campaigns: Offer personalized discounts and perks to customers identified as high-risk.
- Feedback Loops: Implement feedback mechanisms to continually improve services.
- Network Enhancement: Resolve connectivity issues and ensure seamless service delivery.


Specific Observations:
- Customers on the International Plan exhibit a higher churn rate.
- Customers with four or more service calls churn significantly more often.
- Variables like day/evening calls, night minutes, and voicemail messages showed no clear association with churn.


Final Notes:
This project highlights the potential of machine learning and advanced analytics in solving complex business challenges. While the current model shows outstanding performance, continuous monitoring, validation, and retraining with new data are recommended to maintain its accuracy and relevance. By leveraging XGBoost and SHAP, this project equips telecom companies with actionable insights to proactively reduce churn, improve customer satisfaction, and drive long-term profitability
